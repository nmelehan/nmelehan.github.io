        <p>This is just a photo series of a work desk I have been building. There&rsquo;s a location in Philadelphia called NextFab that has a bunch of useful tooling, and I&rsquo;m enjoying this project a lot: <a href="https://nextfab.com">NextFab</a>.</p>

<p>The table measures about 2.5&rsquo; wide by 7&rsquo; long, and it&rsquo;s a standing height desk:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/images/work-desk-routing-project/assembled.jpg" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Assembled, pre-routing</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The plywood was not the highest level of furniture-grade, so it was cheaper, but it also meant that it had some ugly imperfections on the surface. Here&rsquo;s the two that stand out:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/images/work-desk-routing-project/knots.jpg" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Knots</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of living with those, so I came up with a plan to disguise them. The plan involved routing out a fancy pattern on the surface of the table that looked intentional. The pattern would also cover those two imperfections.</p>

<p>After some thinking, I decided to route out a dampened sine wave pattern. The next step was to measure where the imperfections were located on the table, and then fit a sine wave curve perfectly to it. For the curve-fitting, I wrote up a Processing.org sketch and toggled different parameters until I got a wave that went over both problem areas.</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/images/work-desk-routing-project/processing-pattern.jpg" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Processing.org pattern</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The easiest way to cut this out of the table would be to use a CNC router. NextFab has a nice big CNC router, but I haven&rsquo;t taken the classes for it yet, so I can&rsquo;t use it for the time being.</p>

<p>However, I do have access to the laser engraving table:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/images/work-desk-routing-project/laser-table.jpg" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Laser table</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>This meant that I could cut the pattern out of some <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> scrap plywood and use that as a guide for a hand-router. Here&rsquo;s the laser cutter at work:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/images/work-desk-routing-project/laser.jpg" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Laser</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the plywood on top of the table. The pattern perfectly matched where I measured the imperfections to be:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/images/work-desk-routing-project/routing-progress.jpg" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Routing progress</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like after the routing:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/images/work-desk-routing-project/finished-routing.jpg" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Finished routing</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The planning for this took much, much longer than actually routing it out once I had the pattern all done. This is my first big woodworking project, and I&rsquo;d been afraid to cut into the surface of it, but detailed planning paid off here.</p>

<p>The next step will be to fill the pattern with a resin and then seal it over. I had been thinking of using a bright red resin, but now I&rsquo;m considering using something clear, as I like how it looks right now.</p>
